# DeepTumour

The DeepTumour algorithm predicts the tissue of origin of a tumour based on the pattern of passenger mutations identified by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).


## Running DeepTumour

**Requirements:**
- [hg19](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/latest/) reference (`.fa` & `.fa.fai`)


### Docker

1. Study the command options:
    ```sh
    docker run --rm ghcr.io/lincolnsteinlab/deeptumour:latest --help
    ```

2. Run DeepTumour _(assuming VCFs and reference are under the current working directory)_:
    ```sh
    docker run --rm -a stdout -a stderr -v .:/WORKDIR ghcr.io/lincolnsteinlab/deeptumour:latest [OPTIONS] --stdout > [OUTPUT_JSON]
    ```


### Local Environment

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.9
- Pip

1. Install Python dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r ./requirements/requirements.txt
    ```

2. Study the command options:
    ```sh
    python DeepTumour.py --help
    ```

3. Run DeepTumour:
    ```sh
    python DeepTumour.py [OPTIONS]
    ```
